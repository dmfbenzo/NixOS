# NixOS
a mini kernel coded in C/C++
look, i'm not a pro, i'm just toying around with this project. it's not
like i can even think this will be the next linux or next FreeDOS. i'm
just having fun (= also, it will be more like a O/E instead of a O/S a
operating Envrionment. it will run inside other o/s's as a user space
program.
